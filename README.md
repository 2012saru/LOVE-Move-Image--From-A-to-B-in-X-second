# How to implement move image(s) from point A to B in x sec using LOVE 2D game framework.

The framework provides base graphic draw functions. For example draw a image at point A.
But, more frequently a game developer has to implement move image(s) from point A to B in a given time.

This project demonstrates how to do it.

If possible please leave a comment if copy and past a code from here.
